    <div class="w3-blue" id="tour">
    This week there is a lot happeneing. There are multiple parts, so be prepared to read. The first part is follow along the first video provided to us. So first thing I did was put down a breadboard and a arunio board.
    <img src="img/E1.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I connected the 5 volts to the positive terminal
    <img src="img/E2.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I connected the ground to the negative terminal
    <img src="img/E3.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next it is time to set up the LED, which stands for Light-emitting diode. The difference between a LED and a regular light is that the current flow in one direction.
    <img src="img/E4.png" width=740 height=370>
    The current has to run from the anode to the cathode. so I connected the anode to the positve terminal and the cathode to the negative terminal
    <img src="img/E5.png" width=740 height=370>
    If you start the simulation the LED is overloaded so now we have to fix that.
    <img src="img/E6.png" width=740 height=370>
    So you would have to put in a resistor and I set it to 400 ohms. In real life you would have to do math but I am very happy we dont have to do that here.
    <img src="img/E7.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next we add a button, it works by connecting together the first terminal and the second terminal.
    <img src="img/E8.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then we add a LED to that button. So you connect with a resistor the first terminal of the button to the negative terminal and set it to 400 ohms. Then connect the anode to the positve terminal.
    <img src="img/E9.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then if you run the simultion and press the button it should work.
    <img src="img/E10.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next is the potentiometer, it takes in postive current and will resist it depending on how you turn it. The wiper is the output and the terminals are the imput
    <img src="img/E11.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I connected the Wiper to the anode of a LED and then Terminal 1 to positive terminal and terminal 2 to a negative terminal and the cathode to the negative terminal.
    <img src="img/E12.png" width=740 height=370>
    That was the end of Video 1 so now onto Video 2. So the first thing I did was put down the ardino.
    The only coding knowlage I know is playing around with stratch making really bad pokemon, total drama shows with my sister when I was 8 so as you can tell, I am a master at coding. JK I have no idea what I am doing. So first thing is first, delete everything.
    <img src="img/E14.png" width=740 height=370>
    The setup side is for a one time thing while the loop side is for repeating things. First we looked at the void setup, it is basically a box that holds infromation and can either be constant or not constant. Then what you have to do is declare what type of number is going in, in this case a integer, the name of it, and the amount
    <img src="img/E15.png" width=740 height=370>
    I did the same thing with the variable income
    <img src="img/E16.png" width=740 height=370>
    You can add them together like so.
    <img src="img/E17.png" width=740 height=370>
    Now we had the issue of seeing it so we set up a Serial connection. It basically allowed us to see our work with Serial begin and Serial print
    <img src="img/E18.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next we added another line of text that shows the money before the equation and a word and then after the equation using the Serial.print. the Serial.prinln just makes it go onto another line and makes it look better.
    <img src="img/E19.png" width=740 height=370>
    Now just showing a few other operations it can do, in order, you can lose money.
    <img src="img/E20.png" width=740 height=370>
    Multiplication
    <img src="img/E21.png" width=740 height=370>
    Divison
    <img src="img/E22.png" width=740 height=370>
    Modulo operation, the left over from the divison
    <img src="img/E23.png" width=740 height=370>
    If and else statment, if the variable equals what it is supposed to, do this, if it doesnt, do this other thing. In this case money did = 4 so it printed out rich.
    <img src="img/E24.png" width=740 height=370>
    In this case money did not = 4 so it printed out Poor :(
    <img src="img/E25.png" width=740 height=370>
    That was the end of the second video, onto video 3. Now we are combining everything... oh joy. The first thing I did was set up the board and the ardino.
    <img src="img/E26.png" width=740 height=370>
    First we set up the LED as before, but this time brought the anode to terminal 2 on the ardino.
    <img src="img/E27.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then we went into the coding made a global constant, LED=2, and replaced all the 13s with LED.
    <img src="img/E28.png" width=740 height=370>
    When you start the simulation the LED will blink.
    <img src="img/E29.png" width=740 height=370>
    Now going back to the button connect terminal 1 to ground and terminal 2 to ardino 3.
    <img src="img/E30.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then also connect terminal 2 to positive and 5V to positive.
    <img src="img/E31.png" width=740 height=370>
    We do this so when the button is pressed the power gets turned off. But it will short circuit so we have to add a pull up or pull down resistor and set it to 10 kilo ohms.
    <img src="img/E32.png" width=740 height=370>
    Now it is time to code the button. First we created a variable Button. Next we created a if statment and a new function digitalRead, and set that so when the button is low the LED will blink.
    <img src="img/E33.png" width=740 height=370>
    Now it is off to try and do things on my own. The first assigment is coding. So obviously the first thing I did was lay down my ardino.
    <img src="img/E34.png" width=740 height=370>
    I set up my integers, DinoNuggets and RegularNuggets, can you tell I was hungry while making this? I set DinoNuggets to 3 and RegularNuggests to 4, very upset I had more RegularNuggets than DinoNuggets but I brought this appon myself.
    <img src="img/E35.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I put in Serial.begin to make sure everything shows. Then I did multiplication by coding DinoNuggets*2. Then under that do the command Serial.println(DinoNuggets)
    <img src="img/E36.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then for division I did the same thing but instead of DinoNuggets I did my RegularNuggets. I did ReuglarNuggets/2.
    <img src="img/E37.png" width=740 height=370>
    Now onto the modulo opperation. That is what gives you the remains after divsion. So I did RegularNuggets/DinoNuggets and it give me the value 1 because the remains are 1.
    <img src="img/E38.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next for my if else opperation I set it as if I have more dino nuggets than regular nuggets it makes me happy but if I dont then it makes me sad. In this case I did not have more dino nuggets.
    <img src="img/E39.png" width=740 height=370>
    But in this case I did have more dino nuggets :)
    <img src="img/E40.png" width=740 height=370>
    The next assigment is when you push the button the LED's light up in a sequence. So like always the frist thing I do is bring out the ardino and the board.
    <img src="img/E41.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next I set up the negative and positive terminals on the ardino to the board.
    <img src="img/E42.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I set up my LEDs and put in the resistor for each one setting it at 400 ohms.
    <img src="img/E43.png" width=740 height=370>
    The next thing I did was set up my LEDs to the ardino so I am able to code them.
    <img src="img/E44.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I set up variables for each LED
    <img src="img/E45.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next I set up my code, I set the pinmode to output for all of the pins. Then for the Loop section I have it as the LED hold its on position for 500 milliseconds and have it off for 1000 milliseconds. I did that for each LED.
    <img src="img/E46.png" width=740 height=370>
    After that I set up my button. So I connected terminal 1 to ardino 7 I connect terminal 2 to the negative terminal, and made a resister for terminal 1, and set that to 10 kilohms. I ran it to make sure that it works.
    <img src="img/E47.png" width=740 height=370>
    Next I connected the button to the code. So under the set up the pinmode in the set up area for the button. Then I did a if function to make if if the button level is low then have them blink and turn on.
    <img src="img/E48.png" width=740 height=370>
    It worked!
    <img src="img/E49.png" width=740 height=370>
    The next assigment is to count but every 5 it says your name. So the first thing I did like always is open a new project and set dow my ardino.
    <img src="img/E50.png" width=740 height=370>
    The first thing I did was make a variable outside any of the set ups, count =1. Then during the set up section I started the Serial. Then during the loop section I did the function count=count+1 then Serial.println(count) so the numbers start counting up. Than I ran it to make sure that it worked.
    <img src="img/E51.png" width=740 height=370>
    So the saying my name part of the project I set it as when the number divided by 5 has a left over of 0 it would print my name. This is so whenver it is a multiple of 5 it will type out my name and not the number. I used a if else statment and the else was showing the count. Then outside the statment I did the regular equation of count +1.
    <img src="img/E52.png" width=740 height=370>
    Then I ran it to make sure that it worked and it did.
    <img src="img/E53.png" width=740 height=370>
